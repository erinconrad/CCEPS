Look at first artifact (our candidate s). Then see if there are at least allowable_nums
correctly spaced from it (s, s+freq, s+2freq, etc.). If there are, this is
our s, and extra ones can be ignored. If not, move on to the 2nd artifact
as our candidate s.

%% Old probably too computationally intensive way
%{
%{
Idea is that I will loop through allowable_nums and for all n artifacts
look at all n choose allowable_nums possible sets. I will see if I can get
them to fit the beat. If not, I will move to the next. If nothing works, I
will throw an error

Expect allowable nums will be [30, 29] (allow one dropped beat)
