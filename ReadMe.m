%% CCEPs code

%{
This code takes data from cortical stimulation sessions and measures
cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs).

Before running the code, you will need to:

1) create a file called cceps_files
somewhere in your path, that will output a structure with the following
elements:
-locations.script_folder (containing the path to the folder containing the
CCEPs code)
-locations.data_folder (containing the path to the folder containing the
xlsx file with a list of ieeg.org filenames)
-locations.results_folder (containing the path to the folder where we will
output results)
-locations.loginname (containing your ieeg login name)
-locations.pwfile (containing the path to your ieeg password)
-locations.ieeg_folder (containing the path to ieeg codebase)

See the script cceps_files_example.m for an example of how to structure
this file.

2) put a file called master_pt_list.xlsx in the path of the data folder.
This should contain a list of ieeg.org files to run. Here is an example:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXCDxgi9CC3ZN--OxNMukBWiGDBvhyxok_9VuzP0CD4/edit?usp=sharing


2) Then, navigate to the folder do_run/updated_pipeline/
>> do_all_pts_v2

The code works according to the following pipeline
1) Downloads ieeg data for the stim session
2) Automatically identifies very high amplitude signals in each channel
(candidates for potential stim artifacts)
3) It then narrows these candidate artifacts down to those that occur on an
expected beat (e.g., 1 Hz for 30 times) consistent with the stimulation
parameters. 
4) It then determines which channel the stimulation occurred on based on
the highest amplitude stimulation, and returns the final list of
stimulation artifacts
5) It then performs averaging of the EEG signals during the stimulation
period, time-locked to the stimulus artifact
6) It then automatically identifies the N1 and N2 waveforms of the CCEPs,
with some basic artifact rejection
7) It then builds a CCEPs network based on either N1 or N2 amplitude.
8) It outputs a structure called "out" containing CCEPs waveforms and a
network and saves it to the results folder
